# Design Psychology

## Overview

Psychological principles and cognitive biases that influence human behavior and decision-making. Understanding these allows designers to create more intuitive, engaging, and effective user experiences.

## Guiding User Decisions

### Hick's Law
The time to make a decision increases with the number of options. *Minimize choices to streamline decision-making.*

### Default Effect
Tendency to favor the default option. *Thoughtfully set defaults to guide users towards desired paths.*

### Social Proof
In unfamiliar situations, we copy others' actions. *Demonstrate user activity through testimonials, ratings, or social shares.*

### Centre-Stage Effect
People tend to select the middle option. *Consider placing preferred options in the middle when differences are clearly communicated.*

### IKEA Effect
People value things they partially assembled themselves. *Involve users in co-creation or personalization.*

### Anchoring
People depend heavily on initial information when deciding. *Carefully consider the first piece of information presented.*

### Mere Exposure Effect
We prefer things we're familiar with. *Maintain consistency in design and patterns.*

### Gifting
We feel the need to reciprocate when receiving a gift. *Consider small, thoughtful gestures to build goodwill.*

## Creating Great Experiences

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Aesthetically pleasing designs are perceived as easier to use. *Invest in visual design and polish.*

### Delighters
We respond favorably to small, unexpected pleasures. *Incorporate amusing microcopy or delightful animations.*

### Peak-End Rule
We judge experiences by their peaks and how they ended. *Design user journeys with pleasant peaks and strong endings.*

### Serial Position Effect
We remember first and last items in a list best. *Place important items at beginning and end.*

### Recognition Over Recall
It's easier to recognize than recall. *Make information visible and easily accessible.*

### Pareto Principle (80/20)
80% of effects come from 20% of causes. *Focus effort on areas bringing largest benefits to most users.*

### Jakob's Law
Users prefer your site to work like sites they already know. *Follow established conventions unless there's significant reason not to.*

### Fitts's Law
Time to acquire a target depends on distance and size. *Design interactive elements to be large enough and easily reachable.*

### Zeigarnik Effect
People remember uncompleted tasks better. *Leverage for onboarding or multi-step processes.*

### Doherty's Threshold
Productivity soars when response time is <400ms. *Optimize system performance and response times.*

### Von-Restorff Effect
The item that differs from others will be remembered. *Use visual distinction for key elements like CTAs.*

## Avoiding Research Mistakes

### Observer-Expectancy Effect
Researchers may unconsciously manipulate experiments to find expected results. *Implement blind studies; ensure diverse perspectives.*

### Blind Spot Bias
We see ourselves as less biased than others. *Practice self-awareness; actively seek feedback.*

### Confirmation Bias
We like data confirming our beliefs. *Actively seek data that challenges assumptions.*

### Congruence Bias
Testing our own hypothesis repeatedly instead of alternatives. *Explore and test alternative solutions.*

### Illusion of Validity
Overestimating ability to predict from coherent data. *Maintain healthy skepticism; validate with diverse methods.*

### False-Consensus Effect
Assuming others share our beliefs. *Conduct thorough research with diverse participants.*

## Avoiding Bad Decisions

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
Persevering because of past investment regardless of current merit. *Be willing to pivot despite past investments.*

### Bandwagon Effect
Doing things because others do them. *Base decisions on user needs and data, not trends.*

### Loss Aversion
We hate losing more than we like gaining equivalently. *Frame choices in terms of gains rather than losses.*

### Status Quo Bias
Preferring things to stay the same. *Clearly communicate benefits of changes; minimize perceived loss.*

### Parkinson's Law
Tasks expand to fill available time. *Use timeboxing and strict deadlines.*
