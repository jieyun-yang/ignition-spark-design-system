# Support Article Link Guidelines

## Overview

The Support article link component serves to direct users to relevant support documentation. It typically appears as a textual link, such as "Learn more" or a direct question (e.g., "How do I create a schedule or invoice?"), or as a question mark icon.

## Usage Guidelines

The Support article link is used in specific contexts to provide supplementary information:

*   In grey boxes within a Client record to link users to support articles.
*   Within field sets in the caption to link users to support articles.
*   In the page header, positioned beside the page title, to provide an explanation of the section via a support article.

## Anatomy/Structure

The Support article link component can manifest in two primary visual forms:

*   **Text Link**: A clickable text string, often phrased as "Learn more" or a direct instructional question (e.g., "How do I create a schedule or invoice?").
*   **Question Mark Icon**: A standalone question mark icon, typically located in the page header.

## Best Practices

### Do

*   Use it sparingly to direct users to learn more about how to complete a task.

### Don't

*   Rely on support articles; tasks within the product should be intuitive and self-explanatory.
