# Illustrations

## Overview

Illustrations are foundational design elements used to quickly communicate information, influence mood, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Illustration Types

### Spot Illustrations
Smaller, focused illustrations highlighting a specific element or concept without extensive contextual background.

### Scene Illustrations
Complex illustrations depicting broader narratives or contexts, involving characters, environments, or multiple elements to tell a story or set a mood.

## When to Use

- To quickly communicate information
- To influence user's mood or emotional state
- To support the user experience

## Product Contexts

### Empty States

Match the emotional tone of the illustration to the message and user's sentiment:

| Tone | Usage | Example |
|:-----|:------|:--------|
| **Neutral** | Default, factual messaging | "No draft proposals" |
| **Positive** | Positive outcome or desired state | "No outstanding tasks", "No overdue billing" |
| **(Slightly) Negative** | Absence isn't ideal, encouraging action | "No active or lead clients" |
| **Very Positive** | Significant achievements or celebrations | Major milestones |

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Use Carefully:** Illustrations are powerful but overuse can be distracting
- **Determine Type:** Consider whether icon, spot, or scene illustration is most suitable
- **Focus on the Message:** Illustrations must support and clarify user understanding
- **Prioritize Quality:** Avoid generic library illustrations if they only "okay" communicate - create bespoke if needed
- **Design for Emotion:** Consider the emotional reaction you want to elicit

### Don'ts
- Don't reuse the same illustration in different, unrelated contexts
- Don't use illustrations that hinder rather than support understanding
- Don't show Intro banner and empty state on the same page simultaneously

## Future Considerations (TBD)

Guidelines for illustration usage in:
- Navigation
- Onboarding
- Modals
- Error messages
