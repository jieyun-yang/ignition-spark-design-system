# Figma Resources

## Overview

Key Figma assets and their intended usage within the design system for streamlined workflows, project alignment, and efficient UI creation.

## Big Rock Template

### Purpose
Functions as the **single source of truth** for "big rock" projects, ensuring alignment across Design, Product Management, and Engineering on planned scope.

### Content
Primarily houses the confirmed, planned scope for a project.

### Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Planned Scope Pages** | Core area with finalized design work and confirmed features |
| **Shaping Pages** | Early-stage conceptualization, problem framing, initial exploration |
| **Playground Pages** | Experimental designs, alternative solutions, speculative explorations |

### Best Practices

- Keep shaping & exploration in designated pages, separate from planned scope
- Use the template as the definitive reference for what is being built
- Start all "big rock" projects with this template for stakeholder alignment

## Component Library

### Purpose
Centralized collection of standardized, pre-built components to accelerate design and ensure consistency.

### Usage
- Quickly assemble and create designs
- Ensure adherence to design system guidelines
- Maintain consistency across all design work

### Best Practices

- Always build designs using components from the central library
- Check for existing components before creating custom solutions
- Contribute new patterns back to the library when appropriate
