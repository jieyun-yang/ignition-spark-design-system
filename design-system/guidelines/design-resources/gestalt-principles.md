# Gestalt Principles

## Overview

Gestalt principles describe how humans perceive and organize visual information into coherent wholes rather than individual parts. Understanding these helps create intuitive, clear, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

## Core Concepts

### Emergence
People identify elements first in their general outlined form. The brain recognizes simple, well-defined objects quicker than detailed ones.

### Reification
People recognize objects even when parts are missing. The brain matches what we see with familiar patterns and fills in gaps.

### Multi-stability
Ambiguous objects are interpreted in more than one way. The brain bounces between alternatives, with one view becoming dominant.

### Invariance
Simple objects are recognized regardless of rotation, scale, or translation. The brain perceives objects from different perspectives.

## Principles for UI Design

### Proximity
Elements placed close together are perceived as a group or related.

**Application:** Group related form fields, navigation items, or content sections together.

### Common Region
Elements within the same closed region (border, background shape) are perceived as belonging together.

**Application:** Use containers, cards, or backgrounds to group related elements.

### Similarity
Elements sharing visual characteristics (color, size, shape, orientation) are perceived as related.

**Application:** Use consistent styling for similar actions or content types.

### Continuity
Elements on a line or curve are perceived as more related than those not on the path.

**Application:** Align elements to create visual flow; use progress indicators.

### Closure
People perceive incomplete shapes as complete figures, filling in missing information.

**Application:** Leverage implied shapes in logos or icons; use partial borders effectively.

#### Related: Positive and Negative Space
Positive and negative space combine in closure to form wholes. Look for hidden forms in negative space.

#### Related: Contrast
Strong contrast between foreground and background is key to forming closure. Black and white creates best contrast.

#### Related: Colour
Color adds life and can reinforce relationships, especially with abstract shapes.

### Figure-Ground
The visual system simplifies scenes into main object (figure) and background (ground). Figure is perceived as closer and more dominant.

**Application:** Clearly distinguish primary content from backgrounds; use overlays effectively.

### Focal Point
Whatever stands out visually captures attention first. Unique elements in color, size, shape, or placement become focal points.

**Application:** Make CTAs and important elements visually distinct.

## Practical Applications

| Principle | UI Application |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Proximity | Group related controls together |
| Common Region | Use cards to contain related content |
| Similarity | Consistent button styling for same action types |
| Continuity | Align navigation items horizontally |
| Closure | Use icons that leverage implied shapes |
| Figure-Ground | Modal overlays on dimmed backgrounds |
| Focal Point | Distinct CTA buttons |
